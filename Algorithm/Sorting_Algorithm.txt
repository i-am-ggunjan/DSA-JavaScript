Sorting :-
    A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order.

Comparison based sorting :–
    In comparison based sorting, elements of an array are compared with each other to find the sorted array.
        1. Bubble sort
        2. Insertion sort
        3. Selection sort
        4. Merge sort
        5. Heap sort
        6. Quick sort

Non-comparison based sorting :–
    In non-comparison based sorting, elements of array are not compared with each other to find the sorted array.
        1. Radix sort
        2. Count sort
        3. Bucket sort


In-place/Outplace technique :-
    A sorting technique is in-place if it does not use any extra memory to sort the array while a sorting technique is out-place if it requires an extra memory to sort the array.

    Among the comparison based techniques discussed, only merge sort is outplaced technique as it requires an extra array to merge the sorted subarrays.

    Among the non-comparison based techniques discussed, all are outplaced techniques.
    Counting sort uses a counting array and bucket sort uses a hash table for sorting the array.
